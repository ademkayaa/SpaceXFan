- [x] 6- The application should know its state when the user pushes it in the background. For example,
   - I opened a rocket detail in the "SpaceX Fan" application
   - I received a Slack message and opened Slack message 
   - I then returned to "SpaceX Fan‚Äù; the state should be the same as when I left "SpaceX Fan".

- [x] 7. (BONUS) Create a cloud service on any cloud service provider (Amazon, DigitalOcean, Google, Firebase etc.) free services provided are enough to handle. Create a primitive user login and dummy user database on cloud. Keep favorite rockets of dummy users on the cloud and make appropriate changes on mobile applications.
